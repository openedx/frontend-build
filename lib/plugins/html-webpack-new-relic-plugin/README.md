# html-webpack-new-relic-plugin

This plugin comes from https://github.com/victorrodrigues/html-webpack-new-relic-plugin.

We're bringing it into frontend-build so that we can more easily maintain the new relic snippet.  We
haven't found much value in having it as a separate package - it mostly just adds a step when we're
trying to keep it up to date.
