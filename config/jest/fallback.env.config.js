  // DO NOT PUT ANY CONFIGURATION IN THIS FILE.

  // env.config.js files for jest.

  // This file is used as a fallback to prevent build errors if an env.config.js file has not been
  // defined in a consuming application.  If we could inline an empty object instead of needing a
  // file to reference, that'd be clearer, but doesn't seem to be an option.

  // This is NOT an appropriate place to put actual configuration values for tests.
